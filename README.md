# CPP_Classes_and_Objects
The classes are the most important feature of C++ that leads to Object Oriented Programming. 
Objects are instances of class, which holds the data variables declared in class and the member functions work on these class objects.
Class name must start with an uppercase letter (It is not mandatory.).
Class is mere a blueprint or a template.
Each object has different data variables.
